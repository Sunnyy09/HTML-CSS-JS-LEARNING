      In the case of the reduce() method, you should is used it when you want to
      perform some operation on the elements of an array and return a single
      value as a result. The "single value" refers to the accumulated result of
      repeatedly applying a function to the elements of a sequence.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      For example, you might use reduce() to sum up all the elements in an
      array, to find the maximum or minimum value, to merge multiple objects
      into a single object, or to group different elements in an array.
    </h2>
    <script>
      let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

      //   let totalSum = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => {
      //     return sum + num;
      //   });
      //   console.log(totalSum);

      //Simplest way to write the function
      let totalSum = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0); //0 = initial Value
      console.log(totalSum);
